# Kyber PKE Toy Implementation

This repository contains a toy implementation of the Kyber Public Key Encryption (PKE) scheme and Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) . This implementation is intended for educational purposes only.

## Overview

Kyber is a lattice-based cryptographic algorithm that provides secure public key encryption and key encapsulation. This implementation is not the complete version of kyber, but have some optimization.

## Usage

Can see example in main.

## Disclaimer

This is a toy implementation and is intended for educational purposes only. It should not be used for any other purpose. The implementation may lack optimizations and security features present in production-ready cryptographic libraries.

## Future Work
We are planning on improving this implementation by adding some more optimizations like NTT and fixing some other security problems.
